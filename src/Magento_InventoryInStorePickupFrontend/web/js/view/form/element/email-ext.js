/**
 * Originaly we modified checkout and introduced "AS guest" and "As registered" tabs.
 * When store pickup kicks in it would cause nested tabs logic which hurts UX.
 * So when store pickup is available we replace original tabs with "Shipping"/"Store Pickup"
 * In this case to keep original mopdification too, it has been moved to content and is now displayed as text. Either "I have an account. {link}Log in{/link}" or "{link}I'm new here{/link}".
 * Links toggle shipping form fields as in original modification
